The name **“mmmbar”** stands for “Marketing Mix Models - Business
Analytics in R.” The goal of mmmbar is to standardize and streamline
marketing mix model fitting and insights generation. As the team and its body of
work grows, having well tested, standardized code will ensure that our
results are sound across analyses, will streamline our workflow, and
encourage easy to share code and reproducible results. The **mmmbar**
functions help the user with the APL transformations, model fitting, and
counterfactual generation. From the counterfactuals we have extension
functions to pull impactable share, ROI/mROI, AIMS table inputs, etc.
**mmmbar** is part of the “lillybar” universe.
